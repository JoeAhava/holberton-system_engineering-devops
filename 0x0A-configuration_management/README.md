## Configuration Management

## Background Context

- Configuration management improves the integrity of servers over time
by providing a framework for automating processes and keeping track of
changes made to the system environment

- It’s the discipline of ensuring that all software and hardware assets
which a company owns are known and tracked at all times—any future changes to these assets are known and tracked.

- Puppet: Configuration Management Tool

- Founded in 2015, Puppet first focused on the provision of a GNU general public license for a configuration management tool but changed to an Apache License 2.0 model as of Puppet version 2.7.0.

- Puppet offers both an open source version and a commercial version of its software, Puppet Enterprise, which runs alongside its Puppet Remediate tool to provide a full configuration management system.

- Although Puppet can run in a server-only model with command-line access, the majority of users run it in full client-server mode, where the servers run as masters and the clients run as agents.
